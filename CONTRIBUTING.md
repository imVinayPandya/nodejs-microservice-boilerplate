# CONTRIBUTING

## filenames:

Regarding filenames most common are short, lower-case filenames. If your file can only be described with two words most JavaScript projects use an underscore as delimiter.

## variables:

Regarding variables same "rules" apply as for filenames. Prototypes or classes however should use camel-case.

## run lint to check linting
    ```npm run lint .```
